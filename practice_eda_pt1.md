**1.** Create a histogram for the `Age` variable from the NHANES
(National Health and Nutrition Examination Study ) study. What features
do you observe? Is there anything particularly problematic? Try changing
the binwidth to see if that affects your conclusions. Another option to
try is `breaks =` instead of bindwidth. What do you think
`breaks = seq(0, 100, 25)` is doing? Try to use something more sensible
than that.

**Answer:**

**2.** Modify your previous chart so that height now represents the
percent in the corresponding interval. Adjust the binwidth so that you
can estimate fairly accurately the percent between the ages of 20 and
30. State your estimate.

**Answer:**

**3.** Create separate frequency polygons for the variable `BPSysAve`
for each category of the variable `BMI_WHO`. All the frequency polygons
should appear on the same graph (not faceted). What are your
observations?

**Answer:**

**4.** In the previous question, did you notice a substantial number of
NA values for the `BMI_WHO` variable? Do some digging and characterize
who the participants are who were missing data on this variable. What do
they have in common? Note: Donâ€™t just use `View()` but instead use the
data wrangling or graphical tools we have learned.
